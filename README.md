ImageSegmentation
=================

Image segmentation using the piecewise-constant Mumford-Shah functional.

The codes implemented here are two techniques for solving the piecewise-constant Mumford-Shah functional. The Chan–Vese method uses a level set approach, while the Esedoglu–Tsai method uses threshold dynamics.

The Chan-Vese code is adapted from Vese's code available at http://www.math.ucla.edu/~lvese/285j.1.05s/TV_L2.m.
