ImageSegmentation
=================

Image segmentation using the piecewise-constant Mumford-Shah functional.

The codes implemented here are two techniques for solving the piecewise-constant Mumford-Shah functional. The Chan–Vese method uses a level set approach, while the Esedoglu–Tsai method uses threshold dynamics.
